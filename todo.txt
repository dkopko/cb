* Figure out why there is a bump for cbbst/cbmap at 10^4 in plot output for
  INSERT and REMOVE operations.
* Determine correct behavior for consolidation.
* Determine correct behavior for garbage-collection.

    this is unnecessarily limiting, but if we wanted it to work
    non-consolidated.
* Determine communications pattern between mutator and GC threads.
