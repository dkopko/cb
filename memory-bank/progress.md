# Progress Status: cb

## Current Project Status

The cb (Continuous Buffer) project is a functional library for memory management based on a power-of-2 sized ring buffer with region-based allocation and support for persistent and partially-persistent data structures. The library serves as the foundation for the klox project's O(1) garbage collection implementation.

## What Works

### Core Functionality

- ✅ Power-of-2 sized ring buffer implementation (`struct cb`)
- ✅ Region-based memory management (`struct cb_region`)
- ✅ Cutoff offset mechanism for mutable/immutable boundary
- ✅ Magic ring buffer implementation avoiding bounds checking
- ✅ Serial number arithmetic for reliable offset comparisons
- ✅ Basic testing infrastructure

### Data Structures

- ✅ Partially-persistent red-black tree implementation (`cb_bst`)
- ✅ Array Mapped Trie implementation (`cb_structmap_amt`)
- ✅ Term handling facilities (`cb_term`)
- ✅ Basic utility functions and support code

### Integration

- ✅ Integration with klox demonstrating practical application
- ✅ Functional test cases validating core components

## In Progress/Needs Improvement

### Implementation Refinements

- ✅ Migrated structmap_amt implementation from klox to cb
- 🔄 Continuing refactoring and migrating code from klox to cb
- 🔄 Enhancing the partially-persistent red-black tree implementation
- 🔄 Optimizing memory usage and reducing unnecessary copying
- 🔄 Improving API design and usability

### Testing and Validation

- 🔄 Expanding test suite coverage
- 🔄 More comprehensive performance benchmarking
- 🔄 Better stress testing for edge cases
- 🔄 Validation of concurrent usage patterns

### Documentation

- 🔄 Better explanations of core concepts
- 🔄 More detailed API documentation
- 🔄 Improved examples of correct usage patterns
- 🔄 Clearer explanation of novel concepts like the magic ring buffer

## Abandoned Components

- ❌ `cb_structmap`: Object ID to offset mapping (abandoned)
- ❌ `cb_lb_set`: Lower-bound set implementation (abandoned)
- ❌ `cb_map`: Map implementation with key-value functionality (abandoned)
- ❌ `cb_struct_id_t` approach: Object identifier system (abandoned)

## Not Yet Started

### Future Enhancements

- ⏳ Memory visualization tools
- ⏳ Better debugging support for continuous buffer state
- ⏳ Performance analysis tools
- ⏳ Extended persistent data structure library
- ⏳ More comprehensive benchmarking against traditional approaches

## Known Issues

### Technical Limitations

1. **Ring Buffer Resizing**:
   - Resizing the ring buffer causes pauses
   - Ideally, program memory size should be known or well-estimated in advance

2. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - The novel memory approach requires careful reasoning
   - Heavy reliance on assertions to maintain correctness
   - Learning curve for developers new to the approach

3. **Performance Tradeoffs**:
   - O(log32(n)) dereferencing cost instead of O(1)
   - Path-copying overhead for persistent data structures
   - Memory overhead for maintaining immutability where needed

## Next Milestone Goals

1. **Klox Code Migration**:
   - ✅ Migrated structmap_amt.h from klox to cb
   - 🔄 Identify additional code in klox that belongs in cb
   - 🔄 Continue migrating appropriate functionality
   - 🔄 Ensure clean integration points

2. **Improved Data Structure Performance**:
   - Optimize partially-persistent red-black tree operations
   - Reduce memory overhead where possible
   - Improve common operation patterns

3. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Create more detailed technical documentation
   - Provide clearer explanations of the memory model
   - Better illustrate usage patterns and best practices

4. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Develop more targeted stress tests
   - Better validation of edge cases
   - More comprehensive performance benchmarking

## Success Criteria Status

- ✅ **Functional Core Implementation**: Complete and passes tests
- ✅ **Integration with klox**: Successfully demonstrated
- 🔄 **Performance Optimization**: Basic implementation complete, refinements needed
- 🔄 **Documentation**: Basic documentation exists, but needs expansion
- 🔄 **API Design**: Functional but needs refinement
