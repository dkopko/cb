      1. **Inform the User:**  
          "No Memory Bank was found. I recommend creating one to  maintain project context. Would you like to switch to Architect mode to do this?"
      2. **Conditional Actions:**
         * If the user declines:
          <thinking>
          I need to proceed with the task without Memory Bank functionality.
          </thinking>
          a. Inform the user that the Memory Bank will not be created.
          b. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'.
          c. Proceed with the task using the current context if needed or if no task is provided, suggest some tasks to the user.
         * If the user agrees:
          <switch_mode>

      1. **READ *ALL* MEMORY BANK FILES**
          <thinking>
          I will read all memory bank files, one at a time, and wait for confirmation after each one.
          </thinking>

            </read_file>
          - WAIT for confirmation.
      2. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' and inform the user that the Memory Bank has been read and is now active.
      3. Proceed with the task using the context from the Memory Bank or if no task is provided, suggest some tasks to the user.
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
