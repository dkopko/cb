# Product Context: cb

## Purpose and Motivation

The cb (Continuous Buffer) project provides a foundational memory management system designed to support novel approaches to garbage collection and persistent data structures. It arose from exploration of alternative memory management schemes that could eliminate pauses during garbage collection while maintaining efficient memory usage.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Garbage Collection Pauses

Traditional garbage collection mechanisms typically cause program execution to pause during collection and compaction phases. These pauses:
- Introduce unpredictable latency spikes in application performance
- Make garbage-collected languages unsuitable for certain real-time applications
- Require complex optimization techniques to minimize

### 2. Memory Fragmentation

Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation frequently leads to memory fragmentation:
- Available memory becomes scattered in small, non-contiguous chunks
- Allocation requests fail despite sufficient total free memory
- Memory compaction introduces additional pauses

### 3. Complex Reference Management

Pointer-based memory models introduce challenges:
- Memory safety issues (null dereferencing, use-after-free, memory leaks)
- Difficulty implementing persistent data structures
- Complex programming models for concurrency

### 4. Performance Tradeoffs

Current memory management approaches force developers to choose between:
- Manual memory management (high performance but error-prone)
- GC with pauses (safer but unpredictable latency)
- Reference counting (deterministic but cycle issues)

## Proposed Solution

The cb library provides an alternative approach with different tradeoffs:

- **Continuous Buffer**: A power-of-2 sized ring buffer for all memory allocations
- **Handle-Based References**: Object IDs for references instead of direct pointers
- **Tri-Partite Memory Model**: Three regions (A, B, C) enabling concurrent GC
- **Persistent Data Structures**: Copy-on-write approach for immutability
- **Wait-Free GC**: Concurrent garbage collection without pausing the main thread

This approach shifts costs from garbage collection (now O(1)) to object dereference (now O(log32(n))), creating a different performance profile that may be beneficial for many application types.

## Intended Use Cases

The cb library is particularly well-suited for:

- **Language Runtimes**: As demonstrated in the klox project
- **Real-Time Systems**: Where predictable, non-pausing memory management is essential
- **Persistent Data Structure Implementations**: Leveraging the immutability model
- **Concurrent Applications**: Where simplified sharing semantics are valuable
- **Resource-Constrained Environments**: Where memory efficiency is critical

## Limitations and Boundaries

The current implementation has some intentional limitations:

- **Ring Buffer Resizing**: While supported, causes pauses (though infrequent)
- **Dereferencing Cost**: O(log32(n)) instead of O(1) for direct pointers
- **Implementation Complexity**: More complex than traditional GC approaches
- **Memory Configuration**: Requires some estimation of total memory needs

## User Experience Goals

As a library for language runtime implementers, cb aims to provide:

- **Clear APIs**: Well-defined interfaces for integration
- **Robust Implementation**: High reliability and correctness
- **Thorough Documentation**: Explaining novel concepts and implementation details
- **Efficient Performance**: Especially for garbage collection operations
- **Simplified Concurrency Model**: Through immutable data sharing

## Relation to Other Projects

- **klox**: Demonstrates the cb library in a working language interpreter
- **Persistent Data Structures Research**: Contributes to this field with novel implementations
- **Garbage Collection Research**: Provides an alternative approach to traditional GC

## Current Status

The cb library is a functional implementation that:
- Provides the core continuous buffer implementation
- Implements the structmap for object lookup
- Includes persistent data structure implementations
- Contains test cases to verify correctness
- Serves as the foundation for the klox language runtime
